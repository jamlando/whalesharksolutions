## Background and Motivation
- Create a modern, responsive landing page for Whale Shark Solutions
- Implement email capture functionality integrated with HubSpot CRM
- Build a professional, brand-consistent user experience

## Brand Colors
Primary Color: #F99F81 (Coral/Orange)
Secondary Colors:

## Tailwind Color Configuration
We will extend the Tailwind configuration to include our brand colors:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'whale': {
          primary: '#F99F81',    // Main brand color
          secondary: {
            deep: '#008EB0',     // Deep blue
            light: '#02B3CE',    // Light blue
            dark: '#002D40',     // Dark navy
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
