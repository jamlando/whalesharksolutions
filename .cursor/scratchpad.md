## Brand Colors
Primary Color: #F99F81 (Coral/Orange)
Secondary Colors:
- #008EB0 (Deep Blue)

## Tailwind Color Configuration
We will extend the Tailwind configuration to include our brand colors:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'whale': {
          primary: '#F99F81',    // Main brand color
          secondary: {
            deep: '#008EB0',     // Deep blue
            light: '#02B3CE',    // Light blue
            dark: '#002D40',     // Dark navy
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Lessons
1. When creating a Next.js project, ensure the project name follows npm naming conventions (lowercase)
2. Always run `npm audit` after installing dependencies to check for vulnerabilities
3. Use the `@layer` directive in Tailwind CSS to organize custom styles and components
4. Create reusable components for better code organization and maintainability
5. Implement proper form validation and error handling from the start
6. Use environment variables for sensitive API credentials
7. Handle both new and existing contacts in HubSpot integration
8. Use TypeScript types from the HubSpot API client for better type safety
9. Implement proper error logging for debugging
10. **CRITICAL**: When integrating with HubSpot API, only use properties that exist in your HubSpot account. The `last_modified_date` property doesn't exist by default and causes 400 errors
11. Always provide clear, user-friendly messages for different scenarios (new vs existing users)
12. Test API endpoints with both new and existing data to catch edge cases

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration by submitting a test email
2. Set up a welcome email workflow in HubSpot
3. Add analytics tracking
4. Deploy to Vercel
